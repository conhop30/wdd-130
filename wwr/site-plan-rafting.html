    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>"Strengthen the bond of man with nature by bringing a thrill of life back into a stale, steel world. Through Roaring Oar, the customer will be emboldened to connect and be revitalized by the raw power water and rock bring to a racing heart." - CEO and Founder, Connor Hopkins</p>
    <!--Developer Note: This website will make planning for a rafting transparent and easy to follow. By doing so, we will encourage the least motivated individuals to attend due to the ease of the process. The website will also entice consumers through visual excitement of previous expeditions and customer experiences.-->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>We are aiming to catch the attention of the 9-5 person and adrenaline junkies alike. By providing a wide variety of Expedition Guides, we can host the most soothing float down memory lane or really rev up the speed through an incessant white mist violating your space. This level of personalization in the market hasn't been addressed yet, giving the regular person the chance to experience such a thrill right after just getting their feet wet. To keep it simple, we will make ourselves available to everyone by a website, so as not to cause mobile frustrations for those less inclined to technological savvy.</p>
    <!--Developer Note: Making the focal point of the website about the easy access to excitement should involve bold colors surrounding sequential progress in booking an expedition. Very select images should be incorporated to share a sense of thrill to booking. Font should be clear and easy to read, but word choice should not be cold.-->

    <h3>Website Logo</h3>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
