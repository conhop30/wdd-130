Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        MIDDLE LEFT "CALL TO ACTION":        
        <h4>Real Time Paused</h4>
        We're putting a Time Warp onto the pacing of Real Time Strategy, but we aren't going to slow any of you RTS players down. This is still your timing battleground; We just molded it to fit the hands of every potential Commander out there.
      </p>
      <p>
        MIDDLE CENTER "CALL TO ACTION":
        <h4>Calling All Commanders</h4>
        Find which Commander best matches your playstyle to conquer the battleground, seizing Terran reign, expanding Protoss unity, or satiating the Zerg swarm.
      </p>
      <p>
        MIDDLE RIGHT "CALL TO ACTION":
        <h4>Brew Your Deck</h4>
        It's your game, so why wouldn't you have access to what cards you can build? Explore all of the possibilities of every Race and Commander. Brew that perfect concoction with general and Commander unique cards alike.

      <h3>Game Overview</h3>
      <h4>Knowledge Is Power</h4>
      <p>
        Knowing what a card does and how it does it is everything. When it needs to happen at RTS pace, it's even more crucial to know at a glance. SC2D cards will provide all of that information in a clean way, allowing for you to focus on how to best beat your opponent rather than beating card functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Your battleground:</b> Traditional card games allow for a full view of the battlegroud... Not in SC2D. You'll have to manage the Fog of War by pushing units into danger to earn that turning point of information.
