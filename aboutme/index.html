    <p>Hey guys, I'm looking forward to this class. Developing any form of code has been exciting to me, so being able to build a tangible website is a really neat way to start off my coding career. Though I'm concerned that it will be much harder than I believe it to be, I'm hoping that the challenge will be good for learning new skills in the long run.</p>
    <p>I got married this year, which has been a massive blessing and interesting road to walk. I learn more about myself every day; The good, the bad, and the ugly. Maria and I are hoping to start a long journey of growth and strength while earning our education here at BYU-I. We love to host board game nights, so if you'd like to spend a night rolling dice and praying that you draw the perfect card, hit me up!</p>
